Note: Although I worked on 80% of the content of this repo (which is optional and is not part of my work contract) outside of work hours and unpaid, just to err on the side of caution I have removed entire directories, parts of some source files, and all of the executables from the repo. Even still, I will gladly remove this repo immediately at the University's request.

None of this repo is usable as-is. It is only intended to be a small showcase of my past work.
Thank you for your understanding.
